🛍️ E-Commerce Backend Project
Backend Development Learning Project - A full-stack e-commerce application where I completed backend challenges and implemented key features including authentication, database management, and API endpoints.

📋 Project Overview
This project was part of my backend development learning journey with Scrimba. The frontend and initial backend structure were provided by the instructor, and I worked through hands-on coding challenges throughout the course to implement the core backend functionality.

🎯 What I Learned & Implemented
Core Backend Concepts:
✅ Middleware - Request processing and route protection
✅ Serving Static Files - Frontend integration with Express
✅ Database Creation - SQLite database setup and schema design
✅ Database Seeding - Populating initial data
✅ Database Queries - CRUD operations with parameterized queries
✅ SQL Queries & Binding - Preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities
Authentication & Security:
✅ express-session Middleware - Session management
✅ Validation - Input sanitization and data validation
✅ Hashing and Bcrypt - Secure password storage
✅ Protecting Routes - Authentication middleware
