# 🛍️ E-Commerce Backend Project

**Backend Development Learning Project**

A full-stack e-commerce application where I completed backend challenges and implemented key features including authentication, database management, and API endpoints.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This project was part of my **backend development learning journey with Scrimba**. The frontend and the initial backend structure were provided by the instructor, and I worked through hands-on coding challenges to implement the core backend functionality.

The main focus of this project is **backend logic, security, and database interaction**, rather than frontend design.

## 🎯 What I Learned & Implemented

### Core Backend Concepts

* ✅ **Middleware** – Request processing and route protection
* ✅ **Serving Static Files** – Frontend integration with Express
* ✅ **Database Creation** – SQLite database setup and schema design
* ✅ **Database Seeding** – Populating initial data
* ✅ **Database Queries** – CRUD operations
* ✅ **SQL Queries & Binding** – Preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities

### Authentication & Security

* ✅ **express-session** – Session-based authentication
* ✅ **Validation** – Input sanitization and data validation
* ✅ **Password Hashing** – Secure password storage using bcrypt
* ✅ **Protected Routes** – Authentication middleware for secured endpoints
